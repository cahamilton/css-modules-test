# css-modules-test

A simple demonstration of [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), using 
[React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)


## Getting Started

Run the following to get started: 

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Inspect the page source and you'll see that all CSS classes from local components have been 
uniquely hashed to work on the global scope - without cascading or collision issues. 

***Huzzah*, Local CSS!**
